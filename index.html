        <h2>Explore Nepal</h2>
        <p>
            Nepal is a diverse country that has become one of the world’s most inspiring tourism
            destinations.
            Known for its Himalayan peaks, rich culture, and warm hospitality, Nepal offers experiences
            that range from adventure and spirituality to nature
            and cultural exploration. Its unique blend of landscapes and traditions makes it a place
            where every traveler finds something unforgettable.

            At the heart of Nepal’s tourism identity is the Himalayas, including Mount Everest, the
            world’s highest peak. Trekking routes such as Everest Base Camp, Annapurna Circuit, Langtang,
            and many others attract adventurers from around the globe. These trails offer not just
            mountain scenery but also encounters with local communities, monasteries, and yak caravans,
            giving travelers a deeper understanding of life in the high Himalayas.

            But Nepal is much more than mountains. The country’s cultural heritage is showcased through
            majestic temples, palaces, stupas, and courtyards found in places like Kathmandu, Patan, and
            Bhaktapur—many of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. These ancient cities reveal
            centuries-old craftsmanship, architecture, and traditions that still live vibrantly today.

            In the southern plains, Nepal offers a completely different experience. Chitwan National Park
            and Bardiya National Park are famous for wildlife safaris where visitors can encounter the
            one-horned rhinoceros, Bengal tiger, elephants, and hundreds of bird species in their natural
            habitat.

            Nepal is also known for spiritual journeys, with sacred sites like Lumbini, the birthplace of
            Lord Buddha, drawing pilgrims and peace seekers from around the world. Meditation centers,
            yoga retreats, and monasteries across the country offer deep spiritual experiences in serene
            environments.

            Beyond its natural and cultural beauty, the true charm of Nepal lies in its people—known for
            their friendliness, warmth, and hospitality. Whether exploring mountain villages, bustling
            cities, or peaceful countryside, visitors feel welcomed and connected.

            With its breathtaking landscapes, diverse cultures, spiritual heritage, wildlife adventures,
            and heartfelt hospitality, Nepal stands as a destination that touches the soul and invites
            travelers to return again and again.
